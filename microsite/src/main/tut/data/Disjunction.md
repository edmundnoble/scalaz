# Disjunction [![GitHub](../img/github.png)](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz/blob/series/8.0.x/base/shared/src/main/scala/scalaz/data/disjunction.scala)

`Disjunction` (or `\/`) is a data type used to signal multiple possible outcomes of a computation.
It is often used when dealing with errors, but is not tied to that case.

**Typical imports**

```tut:silent
import scalaz.data._
import scalaz.Scalaz._
```

# Construction

```tut
val l: String \/ Int = "foo".left
val r: Long \/ Int = 42.right
```

# Pattern matching

```tut
import scala.Predef.println
l match {
  case -\/(left) => println(left)
  case \/-(right) => println(right)
}
```

# Use the Monad instance

```tut
r.flatMap { right =>
  \/-(right)
}
```
